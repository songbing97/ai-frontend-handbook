Q: Animation
  1. Animation has several key points: @keyframes, animation-name, *-duration, *-iteration-count, *-delay.
  2. Firstly, the @keyframes rule defines the keyframes of the animation, including the from, to, and various percentage-based keyframes. These keyframes are combined to form an animation. animation-name defines the multiple animations to be used. animation-delay defines the interval at which the animation executes. animation-duration defines the duration of the animation. animation-iteration-count defines the number of times the animation is executed.

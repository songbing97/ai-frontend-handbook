## What is PM2?

PM2 is a process manager for Node.js applications that simplifies deployment, monitoring, and management of Node.js processes in production environments.

Some key features of PM2 include:

1. Process management: PM2 can manage multiple Node.js processes and monitor their resource usage, uptime, and availability. It can also automatically restart processes that crash or become unresponsive.

2. Load balancing: PM2 can distribute incoming traffic across multiple instances of the same application to improve performance and scalability.

3. Log management: PM2 can aggregate and stream logs from multiple processes to a central location for easy monitoring and troubleshooting.

4. Deployment: PM2 provides a set of command-line tools for deploying Node.js applications to production environments.

5. Monitoring: PM2 includes a built-in dashboard that provides real-time metrics and insights into the health and performance of Node.js processes.

PM2 is widely used in production environments to manage Node.js applications running on a single server or across multiple servers in a cluster. It is open-source and available for free under the MIT license.

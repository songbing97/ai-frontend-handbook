## What is electron?
Electron is an open source platform for building desktop applications using web technologies such as JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It was originally developed by GitHub and has since become a widely-used tool for cross-platform application development.

Built on top of Chromium and Node.js, Electron combines the two to allow developers to build desktop applications using web technologies similar to those used in building websites. Using Electron, developers can create web applications that look and feel like native desktop applications while still supporting multiple operating systems such as Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Some key features of Electron include its ease of use, efficiency, and cross-platform capabilities, making it increasingly popular among developers and businesses alike. Many well-known applications such as Atom, Visual Studio Code, Slack, and Spotify have been built using Electron.

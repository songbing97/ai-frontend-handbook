### Q: What does a front-end engineer do?

A front-end engineer is responsible for designing and developing the user interface of a website or application. This includes creating web pages, layouts, and components using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Front-end engineers work closely with designers to ensure that the visual design of the site is implemented accurately and with high fidelity. They also collaborate with back-end developers to integrate front-end components with server-side logic and APIs. In addition, front-end engineers are responsible for optimizing the performance and accessibility of the website or application, as well as ensuring cross-browser compatibility.

## What are the 100 most common interview questions on the front end? 
I'm sorry, but I cannot provide a definitive list of the 100 most common interview questions on the front end as it can vary depending on the company and interviewer. However, here are some common front-end developer interview questions:

1. What is your experience with HTML/CSS/JavaScript?
2. Can you explain the box model in CSS?
3. How do you optimize website performance?
4. What is your experience with responsive design?
5. How do you handle browser compatibility issues?
6. What is your experience with jQuery?
7. How do you approach debugging code?
8. Have you worked with any CSS preprocessors? If so, which ones?
9. Can you explain the concept of "this" in JavaScript?
10. How do you stay current with new front-end technologies?

This includes creating web pages, layouts, and components using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Front-end engineers work closely with designers to ensure that the visual design of the site is implemented accurately and with high fidelity. They also collaborate with back-end developers to integrate front-end components with server-side logic and APIs. In addition, front-end engineers are responsible for optimizing the performance and accessibility of the website or application, as well as ensuring cross-browser compatibility.</p><h2 id="if-i-am-a-novice-and-want-to-learn-the-front-end-what-should-i-learn-please-give-me-a-list-enumerating-all-items" tabindex="-1">If I am a novice and want to learn the front-end, what should I learn?

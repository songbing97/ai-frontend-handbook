Volumes provide a way for containers to access and modify data outside of their own filesystem.</p><p>Volumes are managed by Docker and are stored separately from containers, which means that even if a container is removed, the data in the volume can still be accessed by other containers with the same volume configuration.</p><p>There are two types of volumes in Docker: named volumes and host-mounted volumes. Named volumes are created and managed by Docker, and can be shared between multiple containers. Host-mounted volumes allow you to mount a directory on the host system into a container.</p><p>Volumes can be specified in the docker run command using the -v option, or in a Docker Compose file using the volumes section.
